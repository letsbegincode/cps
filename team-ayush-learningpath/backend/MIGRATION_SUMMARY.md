## Files Still Need Migration

### Models
- None - all models have been migrated

### Routes (from backend-2/routes/)
- `users.js` â†’ `userRoutes.ts`
- `learningPaths.js` â†’ `learningPathRoutes.ts`
- `progress.js` â†’ `progressRoutes.ts`
- `assessments.js` â†’ `assessmentRoutes.ts`
- `achievements.js` â†’ `achievementRoutes.ts`
- `subscriptions.js` â†’ `subscriptionRoutes.ts`
- `notifications.js` â†’ `notificationRoutes.ts`
- `analytics.js` â†’ `analyticsRoutes.ts`

### Middleware (from backend-2/middleware/)
- `validation.js` â†’ `validationMiddleware.ts`
- `errorHandler.js` â†’ `errorMiddleware.ts` (already exists, may need updates)

### Config (from backend-2/config/)
- `passport.js` â†’ `passport-config.ts` (already exists, may need updates)

### Other Files
- `server.js` â†’ `server.ts` (main server file)
- `course-data.js` â†’ `courseData.ts`

## TypeScript Issues to Resolve

1. **Missing Type Definitions**
   - `@types/mongoose` - needed for mongoose types
   - `@types/express` - needed for Express types
   - `@types/jsonwebtoken` - needed for JWT types
   - `@types/node` - needed for Node.js types

2. **Import/Export Issues**
   - Some models have linter errors due to missing type definitions
   - Need to install missing npm packages

## Next Steps

1. **Install Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/mongoose @types/express @types/jsonwebtoken @types/node
   ```

2. **Migrate Remaining Routes**
   - Convert remaining route files to TypeScript
   - Update imports to use new models
   - Add proper error handling and validation

3. **Update Main Application**
   - Update `src/app.ts` to include new routes
   - Update `src/index.ts` to use new models

4. **Testing**
   - Test all migrated endpoints
   - Verify TypeScript compilation
   - Check database connections and model relationships

## Notes

- The User model has been kept as the final version as requested
- All models include comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Middleware has been updated to support the new authentication patterns
- Routes follow RESTful conventions with proper error handling
- All models include proper indexing and validation
