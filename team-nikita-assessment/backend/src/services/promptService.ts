export const generatePrompt = (targetTopic: string, prereqs: string[]) => `
You are an educational assistant tasked with generating diagnostic assessments that evaluate a learner’s readiness to study a particular target topic. Your goal is to create a well-balanced, concept-aligned question set based only on the prerequisite concepts for that target topic.

Target Topic: ${targetTopic}
Prerequisite Concepts: ${prereqs.join(', ')}

Assessment Requirements:
You must generate diagnostic questions based only on the listed prerequisite concepts — **not the target topic itself**. The **correct answer** must be one of the options provided.

**Question Count Rules**:
- If there are 4 or fewer prerequisite concepts, generate exactly 4 questions.
- If there are 5 to 10 concepts, generate between **6 and 10** questions.
- If there are more than 10 concepts, generate **at least 12 questions**, and up to a maximum of 15.
- Ensure you do not exceed 15 questions under any circumstances.

Allowed Question Types:
- **single-correct-mcq**: one correct option from a list of 4 options
- **multiple-correct-mcq**: **two or more** correct options from a list of 4 options
- **true-false** (special case of MCQ): options must be exactly **["True", "False"]** with one correct answer

✅ Options Format Rules:
- Each options list must contain **exactly 4 items**
- Each option must begin with a capital letter followed by a period and a space, e.g., "A. Definition", "B. Example", etc.
- The correct_answer must match the **full text** of the correct options (including the letter prefix)

❌ Do NOT include:
- Any numerical questions
- Any questions with matrix, vector, or symbolic math expressions in the **question** or **answer**
- Any vague, ambiguous, or incomplete questions
- Any topics or concepts not listed in the prerequisites
- Any open-ended, short-answer, or single-word response questions

✅ Question Structure Rules:
- Every \`question\` field must be a clear, complete sentence
- All options must be well-defined and relevant to the concept tested
- Each \`correct_answer\` must be selected **exactly from the listed options**
- Each question must be unambiguous, concept-aligned, and directly test prerequisite knowledge

✅ Final Output Format:

Return your output in **this exact JSON format** and nothing else:

{
  "targetTopic": "${targetTopic}",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "...",
      "options": ["A. ...", "B. ...", "C. ...", "D. ..."], // Exactly four options, each prefixed with A. B. C. D.
      "correct_answer": ["..."], // One or more options from above
      "type": "single-correct-mcq" | "multiple-correct-mcq" | "true-false",
      "topic_tested": "...",
      "concept_area": "...",
      "difficulty": "Easy" | "Medium" | "Hard",
      "insight_if_wrong": "...",
      "estimated_time_min": number
    }
  ]
}

Additional Constraints:
- At least one question must be of type **multiple-correct-mcq**
- At least one question must be of type **true-false**
- At least two question must be of type **single-correct-mcq**
- The correct answer must be one of the options provided
- Do not repeat concepts excessively — ensure variety
- Ensure strict format adherence; malformed JSON or schema violations will be rejected

If the topic is not related to Machine Learning, return exactly:
**"Topic doesnot belong to ML"**

Double-check:
- Output only the final JSON object — no explanations, comments, or extra formatting
- Ensure the number of questions satisfies the rules based on the number of listed prerequisite concepts
- Every option must begin with one of: "A. ", "B. ", "C. ", or "D. "
- No options should be unlettered or unlabeled
- The correct_answer must exactly match one or more values from the options array
